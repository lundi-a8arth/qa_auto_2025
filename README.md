This project is a mini automation testing framework created as part of the
“Automation Software Testing” course on Prometheus.

The framework is written in Python and demonstrates a clean, modular approach to automated testing.
It includes three core components:

📦 Framework Structure

API Client Module – covers API interactions, request handling, and validation.

Database Module – provides utilities for working with SQLite databases, executing queries, and validating data.

UI Module (Page Objects) – implements Selenium Page Object Model for end-to-end UI testing.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

The project uses widely adopted tools for automation:

pytest — main testing framework

requests — for API testing

sqlite3 — for database interactions

selenium — for browser automation (UI tests)

🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a practical foundation for developing real-world automated tests, showcasing how to structure test modules, organize code, and combine different testing layers (API, DB, UI) into a unified framework.
